*COVID-19 trajectory analysis*

This project imports all available data for cases, tests, deaths, mobility,
hospitalizations, strigency, lockdowns, and more for countries, UK nations
and US States.

The major contribution is the observation of the V-shape trajectories during
social distancing measures and vaccination. It is shown that using the decay
and rebound slopes the basic reproduction number (Ro) can be recovered. This
was also checked by the observed "herd immuntiy".
